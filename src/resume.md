## Experience

### NICTA / CSIRO Data61
**Senior Software Engineer**, Team/Tech Leader &mdash; March 2016 - Present


### OpenSimple
**Owner** &mdash; from July 2013
 
OpenSimple operates as a consulting company with client work focused on building web applications using the Microsoft .NET technology stack.

### Australian Building Codes Board

**Senior Software Developer** &mdash; July 2012 - July 2013 

#### Responsibilities:

* Maintaining an existing e-commerce solution written as a single-page JavaScript web application.
* Administrating and extending an existing Sitecore CMS installation.
* Maintaining an existing in-house Digital Rights Management (DRM) solution.
* Development, testing and deployment of various in-house applications:
    * Bespoke customer management systems.
    * Bespoke ticketing system.
    * XML based desktop publishing software for the NCC/BCC.
* Providing guidance on WCAG 2.0 compliance for all electronic media.

#### Notable Projects:

* Identifying severe security flaws in a system to be transferred to us and proceeding to refactor/rewrite the entire system with additional functionality and tests within a hard deadline of just over two weeks. This project was deemed a great success to our team.
* Bringing an ageing desktop publishing system back to a workable state. When I joined the ABCB the publishing system was in a state of despair due to lack of maintenance over previous 10 years, I was able to resolve all the issues the authors reported and bring the system back up to a stable state. This involved updating Java, .NET, JavaScript, XML/XSLT code-bases.


### VSoft Technologies
**Senior Software Developer** &mdash; 2006 - June 2012

#### Responsibilities:

* Development of the continuous integration tool, [ContinuaCI](https://www.finalbuilder.com/continua-ci), through-out the entire SDLC.
    * Multi-tier ASP.NET MVC Web Application.
    * Cross-process communication via WCF.
    * PostgreSQL & NHibernate for data persistence.
* Involved in a wide range of business decisions including pricing, licensing, marketing and sales of "shrink wrapped software".
* Maintaining and extending an in-house e-commerce application which included porting to the DotNetNuke platform.
* Taking over the design & development of an existing ASP.NET Web-Forms project to the point where the product was released and then continued supporting the product for over 3 major versions.
* Maintaining and supporting an existing Delphi based application, [FinalBuilder](https://www.finalbuilder.com/finalbuilder).
* Interacting with end-users to determine which features are needed in our products to meet their requirements, and then implementing features based on their input.
* Providing all levels of support for their existing products.

#### Notable Projects:

* [ContinuaCI](https://www.finalbuilder.com/continua-ci) was started as a greenfield project by myself and the CEO and continues to be a feature product of the company. The architecture resembles a traditional 3-tier application with the addition of distributed worker agents communicating with the 'logic' layer in a hub and spoke pattern. Some technically interesting parts of the code base that I was responsible for included:
    * Designing the distributed agents to analyse the environments in which they are installed and registering themselves, and capabilities, with the main application server.
    * Developing the workflow engine and web interface that enables the user to configure the build process that is run on the agents.
    * Designing the extensibility layer of the application to allow users to write custom build actions. An aspect of this was the use of .NET attributes to automatically generate a web interface for configuring instances of the actions.
